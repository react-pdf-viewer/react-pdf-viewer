## v4.0.0 [WIP]

**New feature**

It's possible to use the legacy build of pdf-js by using the new worker. It can be used in environments that don't support modern JavaScript features.

```tsx
import { LegacyWorker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/legacy-worker';

<LegacyWorker workerUrl={...}>
    <Viewer ... />
</LegacyWorker>
```

-   Compatible with React Server Components

**Breaking change**

The `Worker` is moved to `@react-pdf-viewer/worker`:

_Install_

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev @react-pdf-viewer/worker
```

_Use the worker_

```tsx
// Before v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

// v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/worker';
```

**Improvements**

-   Implemente a new mechanism to position portal components like Modals, Popovers, and Tooltips. If the desired position causes an overflow, the component will automatically determine the best position to ensure the layout isn't broken.

-   Up until now, pressing the Escape key would close all open popovers and modals. But we've made a change to this behavior. From now on, pressing Escape will only close the topmost popover or modal.

**Bug fix**

-   Render the initial page without loading the document completely
